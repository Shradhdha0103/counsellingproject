        <h2 class="service_title">Healing Through Trauma-Informed Therapy at Nirvana Counseling</h2>
        <p>Imagine walking through life with the weight of the past clinging to your every step. Whether itâ€™s an experience from childhood, a painful relationship, or a traumatic event, the scars often run deeper than we can see. At Nirvana Counseling, we understand how trauma can silently shape your thoughts, emotions, and actionsâ€”and weâ€™re here to help you find your way back to healing and wholeness.</p>

        <h2 class="service_title">The Journey of Trauma ðŸŒŸ</h2> 
        <p>Trauma is personal. It doesnâ€™t have to be something as dramatic as an accident or abuseâ€”it can stem from smaller, everyday hurts that pile up over time. Trauma may not always show on the outside, but it lives within you, affecting how you see the world and how you react to it. For many, it feels like a fog that clouds your decisions, relationships, and sense of self. ðŸŒˆ</p>
  
    
        <h2 class="service_title">Common Symptoms of Trauma ðŸ§ </h2>
        <div class="symptom-list">
          <div class="symptom">
            <h3>ðŸ’” Disconnection</h3>
            <p>Itâ€™s hard to trust others or even yourself. You might find it difficult to feel truly connected, as if thereâ€™s a barrier between you and the rest of the world.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="symptom">
            <h3>âš¡ Hyperawareness</h3>
            <p>Your body is constantly on edge, like waiting for something bad to happen, even when everything seems calm. That sense of dread can feel overwhelming.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="symptom">
            <h3>ðŸš« Avoidance</h3>
            <p>You steer clear of situations, places, or even thoughts that remind you of what happened. Itâ€™s as if staying away is the only way to protect yourself.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="symptom">
            <h3>ðŸŒ‘ Low Self-Worth</h3>
            <p>Youâ€™ve been made to feel that you donâ€™t matter, or perhaps youâ€™ve come to believe that youâ€™re undeserving of love, peace, or success.</p>

        <h2 class="service_title">How Trauma-Informed Therapy Helps You Heal ðŸ’š</h2>
        <p>At Nirvana Counseling, we believe healing doesnâ€™t happen through ignoring or avoiding the past. It comes from understanding, addressing, and gently working through the wounds. Our Trauma-Informed Therapy approach begins with the simple, yet profound idea: You are not your trauma. You are more than the pain youâ€™ve experienced. ðŸŒ±</p>
        <p>We create a space where you feel safe, respected, and empoweredâ€”because your healing journey is uniquely yours. We use techniques like CBT, DBT, EMDR, and EFT to help you slowly uncover the layers of your experiences and start to transform how you relate to them. We work with you to rebuild trust in yourself and others, regain control over your life, and find peace in the present.</p>

      <h2 class="service_title">Your Path to Healing ðŸŒ¿</h2>
      <p>Healing is a process, and itâ€™s not always linear. There will be moments of breakthrough and moments of struggleâ€”but you donâ€™t have to face it alone. Nirvana Counseling is here to walk with you, offering the understanding, care, and support you need to reclaim your life and start anew.ðŸŒ±</p>
      <p>Together, we can turn the page to a chapter where you are no longer defined by the pain of your past, but by the strength you find in your journey forward.</p>
